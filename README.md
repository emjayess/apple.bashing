just some 'dotfiles' for /bin/bash on OS X

-

when bash is invoked as an interactive login shell (default on OS X) it first reads/executes stuff in  
`    /etc/profile`  
  
then  
`    ~/.bash_profile` (sourced upon logging in?)  
`    ~/.bashrc` (sourced upon starting a shell?)  
`    ~/.bash_login`  (?)
`    ~/.profile` (er?)  
  
in that order. or not. i dunno.
